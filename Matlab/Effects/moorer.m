function [y,b,a]=moorer(x,cg,cg1,cd,ag,ad,k)
%This is a reverberator based on Moorer's design which consists of 6 parallel feedback comb filters 
%(each with a low pass filter in the feedback loop) in series with an all pass filter.
%
%The structure is:  [y,b,a] = moorer(x,cg,cg1,cd,ag,ad,k)
%
%where x = the input signal
%      cg = a vector of length 6 which contains g2/(1-g1) (this should be less than 1 for stability),
%           where g2 is the feedback gain of each of the comb filters and g1 is from the following parameter 
%      cg1 = a vector of length 6 which contains the gain of the low pass filters in the feedback loop of
%            each of the comb filters (should be less than 1 for stability)
%      cd = a vector of length 6 which contains the delay of each of the comb filters 
%      ag = the gain of the allpass filter (this should be less than 1 for stability)
%      ad = the delay of the allpass filter 
%      k = the gain factor of the direct signal
%      y = the output signal
%      b = the numerator coefficients of the transfer function
%      a = the denominator coefficients of the transfer function
